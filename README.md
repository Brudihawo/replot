# REPLot

Function evaluation and plotting REPL utility written in rust.

This is currently a work in progress!

## Roadmap
- [x] Tokenizing
- [x] Syntax Tree Generation for lines
- [x] Storing of assignments
- [x] REPL Basics
- [x] Evaluation of expressions
- [ ] Better evaluation (with printing sequence of inputs)
- [ ] use of seq-keyword expression in normal expression (instead of name)
- [ ] Generating sequences of data from functions
- [ ] multi-variable output
- [ ] output sequence of data to file (maybe using ">" operator?)
- [ ] Plotting

## Short Term TODOs:
- [x] convert all `simple_print` function implementations to `std::fmt::Display` trait implementations
